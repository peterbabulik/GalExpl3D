# GalExpl3D

**[Live Demo](https://peterbabulik.github.io/GalExpl3D/)**

Welcome to GalExpl3D, an immersive browser-based space exploration, trading, and crafting game built with **React, TypeScript,** and **Three.js**. Create your pilot, undock your rookie ship, and forge your own path in a vast, persistent universe.

Inspired by the complex, player-driven universe of EVE Online, GalExpl3D features a complete industrial gameplay loop. Mine valuable asteroids, manage your cargo, reprocess ore into minerals, and use them to manufacture everything from advanced modules to powerful new ships. Engage with a fully functional market and take on dynamic, AI-generated missions to build your empire.

    *   Engage with unique **NPC Mission Agents** whose backstories, motivations, and mission objectives are dynamically generated by **Google's Gemini AI**.
    *   Accept logistics and security missions to acquire vital resources and earn ISK, the game's primary currency.
    *   Every mission is a unique narrative experience, providing endless, non-repetitive content.

*   **Advanced UI & State Management:**
    *   **Hierarchical System Overview:** A detailed panel lists all celestial bodies, stations, and asteroids in the system with real-time distance tracking.
    *   **Comprehensive Station Services:** Dock at trade hubs and access a full suite of services including Ship and Item Hangars, Fitting, Crafting, Reprocessing, Market, and Mission Agents.
    *   **Ship Stats Panel:** A real-time display of your current ship's Shield, Armor, and Hull HP, alongside its cargo capacity and mining yield. /// will be implemented :)

## Technology Stack

The project is architected as a modern web application, leveraging a powerful and scalable tech stack:

*   **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: Powers the entire component-based UI, providing a reactive and efficient user experience.
*   **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Ensures type safety and scalability across the complex codebase.
*   **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**: The core of the 3D rendering engine for all in-space visuals.
*   **Google Gemini AI**: Dynamically generates unique NPC agent backstories and mission text for endless, engaging content.

## How to Play

**[Live Demo](https://peterbabulik.github.io/GalExpl3D/)**

### Mission 1 go to Sol. Titan Station, there are some Blueprints. First craft Mining Laser (mine, transfer to station, reprocess, craft) and fit it to your Rookie ship.

**[MANUAL/SHIPS/ORES/BLUEPRINTS](https://github.com/peterbabulik/GalExpl3D/blob/MANUAL.md)**

### Basic Controls
*   **In Space:**
    *   `WASD` + `Space` / `Shift`: Move/Strafe your ship.
    *   `QE`: Roll your ship.
    *   `RF` & Mouse (Hold Left-Click): Pitch and Yaw.
    *   `+/-`: Adjust speed multiplier.
    *   `Enter`: Dock at a station when in range.

### 🚀 Future Roadmap (The Vision Ahead)

The current foundation is robust, paving the way for even deeper and more emergent gameplay. The next major phases of development are focused on creating a truly dynamic, shared universe.

*   **Phase 1: Deepening the Simulation**
    *   [ ] **Comprehensive Combat Mechanics:** Implementing a full damage model (Shield/Armor/Hull), weapon effects (tracking, range, damage types), and e-war modules.
    *   [ ] **Player Skill System:** Adding a character skill tree that allows players to specialize in piloting, industry, combat, and more, providing long-term progression.
    *   [ ] **Loot & Salvaging:** Expanding NPC loot tables to include modules and rare items. Introducing salvaging gameplay to recover components from wrecks.
    *   [ ] **Visual Polish:** Adding 3D models for all ships, drones, and structures to replace the current placeholder geometry.

*   **Phase 2: The Multiplayer Backend**
    *   [ ] **Server Implementation:** Developing a dedicated Node.js backend to act as the authoritative server for the game world.
    *   [ ] **Database Integration:** Storing all persistent player and world data (inventories, market orders, ship locations) in a database.
    *   **Real-Time Communication:** Integrating WebSockets (e.g., using Socket.IO) to synchronize player actions and world state between all connected clients.

*   **Phase 3: A Player-Driven Universe**
    *   [ ] **Player-to-Player Trading:** Converting the NPC market into a fully player-driven market with buy and sell orders.
    *   [ ] **Corporate & Fleet Systems:** Allowing players to form corporations, manage shared assets, and fly in fleets.
    *   [ ] **(Experimental) Blockchain Integration:** Exploring the potential to move core game assets (ships, rare blueprints) onto a blockchain as NFTs, giving players true ownership of their digital assets.
