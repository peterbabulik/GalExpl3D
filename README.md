# GalExpl3D - A Gemini-Powered 3D Space Economy Simulation

Welcome to GalExpl3D, an immersive browser-based space exploration, trading, and crafting game built with **Three.js** and powered by **Google's Gemini AI** for dynamic content generation.

Inspired by the complex player-driven economies of games like EVE Online, this project demonstrates the power of modern web technologies to create a sophisticated simulation‚Äîall within a single HTML file. Pilot your ship in first-person, mine asteroids for valuable ore, refine those materials, and use them to manufacture everything from new ship modules to powerful battleships. Engage with AI-driven mission agents to earn your fortune and make your mark on the galaxy.

## Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run a local instance of the GalExpl3D project.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/peterbabulik/GalExpl3D.git
```
```sh
cd GalExpl3D
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install all the necessary npm packages listed in `package.json`:
```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm install vite @google/genai
```

### 3. Configure Gemini API Key
To enable the AI-powered mission generation, you need to provide your own Google Gemini API key.

1.  Create a new file in the root of the project named `.env`.
    ```sh
    cd GalExpl3D
    ```
    ```
    nano .env
    ```
2.  add the following line, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

### 4. Run the Application
Start the local development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
The application will now be running and accessible at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) (or the next available port).```



## Gameplay & Core Features

GalExpl3D is built around a complete industrial gameplay loop, allowing players to progress from a simple rookie ship to a master industrialist.

*   **Immersive 3D Flight:**
    *   Pilot your ship from a first-person cockpit view with full 6-degrees-of-freedom flight controls.
    *   Seamlessly transition from the vast galaxy map to realistically scaled 3D solar systems.
    *   Your ship's performance (speed, agility) is directly driven by its attributes, making every vessel feel unique.

*   **Mining & Resource Gathering:**
    *   Explore dense, procedurally generated asteroid belts and scan asteroids to find valuable ore.
    *   Target asteroids and use your mining lasers to extract raw resources.
    *   Manage your ship's dedicated **Ore Hold** and watch as you collect the materials needed for industrial domination.

*   **Industrial Gameplay Loop:**
    *   **Crafting:** Dock at a station and use the Manufacturing interface to build new ships, modules, and ammunition from blueprints using the minerals you've gathered.
    *   **Reprocessing:** Refine raw ore into usable minerals in your Item Hangar, forming the building blocks of the entire economy.
    *   **Fitting:** Use the Fitting service to equip your ships with a variety of modules to enhance their capabilities for mining, combat, or defense.

*   **Dynamic, AI-Powered Missions:**
    *   Engage with unique **NPC Mission Agents** whose backstories, motivations, and mission objectives are dynamically generated by **Google's Gemini AI**.
    *   Accept logistics and security missions to acquire vital resources and earn ISK, the game's primary currency.
    *   Every mission is a unique narrative experience, providing endless, non-repetitive content.

*   **Advanced UI & State Management:**
    *   **Hierarchical System Overview:** A detailed panel lists all celestial bodies, stations, and asteroids in the system with real-time distance tracking.
    *   **Comprehensive Station Services:** Dock at trade hubs and access a full suite of services including Ship and Item Hangars, Fitting, Crafting, Reprocessing, Market, and Mission Agents.
    *   **Ship Stats Panel:** A real-time display of your current ship's Shield, Armor, and Hull HP, alongside its cargo capacity and mining yield.

## Technology Stack

This project is a testament to the power of a lean, focused technology stack.
***React: Powers the entire component-based UI, providing a reactive and efficient user experience.
***TypeScript: Ensures type safety and scalability across the complex codebase.
***Three.js: The core of the 3D rendering engine for all in-space visuals.
***Google Gemini AI: Dynamically generates unique NPC agent backstories and mission text for endless, narrative-driven content.
